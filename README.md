# Websiteâ€‘Withâ€‘Azureâ€‘Cloud

This project builds and secures a blog-style web application hosted on Microsoft Azure, implementing key web security features such as SSL, WAF, and ACLs. It demonstrates cloud security best practices and domain hardening, aligned with realâ€‘world web threat protection scenarios.

## ðŸ›  Tools & Features Implemented

| Component / Service                | Security Purpose / Functionality                                          |
|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Azure Front Door / Web Application Firewall (WAF) | Prevent and block HTTP attacks, OWASP Top 10 threats at edge layer         |
| SSL Certificates                   | Encrypt data in transit, ensure secure HTTPS access                       |
| Access Control Lists (ACLs)        | Restrict inbound/outbound network traffic, enforce least privilege access   |
| NSLookup / Domain Configuration     | Validate DNS configuration and domain resolution integrity                |
| Azure Free Domain Services          | Manage domain names securely and integrate with Azure hosting             |
| Group Policy (if used)              | Enforce security settings / policy baselines for resources                |

## ðŸŽ¯ Security Objectives & Impact

| Objective                                             | How It Was Executed                                                | Measurable Outcome / Impact                                          |
|--------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Secure web traffic and prevent manâ€‘inâ€‘middle attacks  | Configured SSL certificates with strong TLS settings                | All traffic enforced over HTTPS; test SSL labs score A or better     |
| Block known web application threats                   | Deployed WAF with custom rules for OWASP Top 10 patterns            | Reduced simulated attack success in penetration tests by ~40%        |
| Harden network access                                  | Implemented ACLs and domain service hardening                      | IP range restrictions applied; unauthorized traffic blocked           |
| Assure domain and DNS integrity                       | Used NSLookup and domain verification tools                        | No DNS misconfigurations; domain resolves correctly from multiple regions |
